# This was the description of the task

Create an application that provides general help in evening movie hunting. The application do 
allows us to search for movies and series based on keywords. Selected from the list of results 
element, display its detailed data sheet highlighting at least 5-6 more important data and also list them 
the characters, and in the case of series, the episodes (if the API provides this). The 
application enable browsing, so e.g. the actors should also have their own data sheet, on which the 
the actor's most important data and roles are displayed. In addition, the application should provide tips for 
for movie selection, so for example enable generally the most popular movies or just a specific one 
also listing the most popular movies related to a movie/theme/genre (according to the possibilities of the API). THE 
to solve this problem, we recommend one of the following 2 APIs: 
- http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/  
- https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=hu
