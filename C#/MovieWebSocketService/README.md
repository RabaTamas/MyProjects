# About this project

I have implemented a WebSocket based service on the .NET platform which 
allows you to manage movies and actors. The application supports creating, deleting, listing of new movies and actors, in addtion loading related entities. It's my job 
the goal was to create a robust and extensible system that is real-time 
provides communication between the client and the server using the WebSocket protocol.

These are technologies, which I used:
- Websocket
- Entity Framework Core
- ASP.NET Core
- JSON and JSON.NET
- HTML
- JavaScript
